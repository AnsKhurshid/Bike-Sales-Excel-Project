# Bike-Sales-Excel-Project

Welcome to the Bike Sales Excel Project! This project showcases my skills in Excel through the process of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using pivot tables and an interactive dashboard.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about bike buyers. The dataset was initially unclean, so the first step was to clean and organize the data. This involved tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in formatting.

Once the data was cleaned, I created a separate worksheet to store the cleaned data, maintaining the integrity of the original dataset while having a structured and organized format for analysis.

## Analysis and Visualization

The core of the project revolved around analyzing the bike sales data to extract meaningful insights. I utilized pivot tables extensively to summarize and aggregate the data based on various factors such as buyer demographics, purchase details, and product preferences.

With the insights gathered from the pivot tables, I then designed an interactive dashboard using Excel's features such as slicers, pivot charts, and conditional formatting. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore the data dynamically, allowing stakeholders to visualize key metrics and trends effortlessly.
